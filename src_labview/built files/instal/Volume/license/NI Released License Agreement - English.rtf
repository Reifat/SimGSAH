11.\tab\ul Copyright; No Other Licenses.\ulnone  The SOFTWARE is owned by NI or its suppliers and is protected by applicable copyright laws and international treaty provisions. Therefore, you must treat the SOFTWARE like any other copyrighted material. You may, however, copy the SOFTWARE solely for backup or archival purposes.

\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-360\li360\sb100\sa240 14.\tab\ul Limited Warranty.\ulnone  Except for SOFTWARE provided under an evaluation license which SOFTWARE is provided without warranty, NI warrants, for your benefit alone, that for a period of ninety (90) days from the date the SOFTWARE is shipped to you (i) the SOFTWARE will perform substantially in accordance with the accompanying written materials, and (ii) the medium on which the SOFTWARE is recorded will be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service. Any replacement SOFTWARE will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer. Some states/jurisdictions do not allow limitations on duration of an express or implied warranty, so the above or any other limitation provided herein may not apply to you. In such event, such warranties are limited to the minimum warranty period allowed by applicable law. You must obtain a Return Material Authorization number from NI before returning the SOFTWARE under warranty to NI and you agree to pay expenses for shipment to and from NI. The Limited Warranty is void if failure of the SOFTWARE has resulted from accident, abuse, misapplication, improper calibration by you, third party products (i.e., hardware or software) used by you which are not intended by NI for use with the SOFTWARE, utilization of an improper hardware or software key (if applicable), or unauthorized maintenance of the SOFTWARE. \par
15.\tab\ul Customer Remedies.\ulnone  NI's sole obligation (and your sole remedy) with respect to the foregoing Limited Warranty shall be to, at NI's option, return the fees paid or repair/replace the SOFTWARE, provided that NI receives written notice of applicable defects during the warranty period. You may not bring an action to enforce your remedies under the foregoing Limited Warranty more than one (1) year after the accrual of such cause of action. \par
16.\tab\ul\b No Other Warranties.\ulnone  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH ABOVE, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND NO OTHER WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED ARE MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR ANY OTHER WARRANTIES THAT MAY ARISE FROM USAGE OF TRADE OR COURSE OF DEALING. NI DOES NOT WARRANT, GUARANTEE, OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OF OR THE RESULTS OF THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE IN TERMS OF CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE AND DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE. NI EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES NOT STATED HEREIN.\b0  \par
17.\tab\ul Intellectual Property Liability.\ulnone  NI shall, at its own expense, defend any claim resulting from your use of the SOFTWARE as authorized by your license to the extent that such claim alleges that the SOFTWARE infringes any patent, copyright, or trademark protected by the laws of the U.S.A., Canada, Mexico, Japan, Australia, Switzerland, Norway, or the European Union, provided that such claim does not arise from your use of the SOFTWARE in combination with equipment or devices not made by NI, or from any modification of the SOFTWARE not made by NI, and further provided that you notify NI in writing immediately upon your obtaining notice of such impending claim and your full cooperation with NI in preparing a defense. If you provide to NI the authority, assistance, and information NI needs to defend or settle such claim, NI shall pay any final award of damages or settlement with respect to such claim and any expense you incur at NI's written request, but NI shall not be liable for a settlement made without its prior written consent. If the SOFTWARE is held to be infringing of the rights stated above and the use thereof is enjoined or if NI believes the SOFTWARE may be held to infringe a third party's intellectual property rights, NI shall, at its option, either (i) procure for you the right to use the SOFTWARE, (ii) replace or modify the SOFTWARE with other software which does not infringe, or (iii) receive your return of the infringing SOFTWARE and refund to you the license fee payment(s) made by you to NI. The foregoing states your sole remedy for, and NI's entire liability and responsibility for, infringement of any patent, trademark, copyright, or other intellectual property right relating to the SOFTWARE. \b THIS LIMITED INDEMNITY IS IN LIEU OF ANY OTHER STATUTORY OR IMPLIED WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT. THE FOREGOING INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS SHALL NOT APPLY TO ANY THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS INCORPORATED IN OR OTHERWISE PROVIDED WITH THE NI PRODUCTS, AND YOU AGREE TO LOOK TO THE APPLICABLE THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURER WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIMS FOR INFRINGEMENT INVOLVING THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS.\b0  \par
18.\tab\ul Limitation On Liability.\ulnone  The entire liability of NI and its licensors, distributors, and suppliers (including its and their directors, officers, employees, and agents) is set forth above. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall NI and its licensors, distributors, and suppliers (including its and their directors, officers, employees, and agents) be liable for any damages, including, but not limited to, any special, direct, indirect, incidental, exemplary, or consequential damages, expenses, lost profits, lost savings, business interruption, lost business information, or any other damages arising out of the use or inability to use the SOFTWARE, any technical support services relating to the SOFTWARE, or related hardware even if NI or its licensors, distributors, and suppliers has been advised of the possibility of such damages. You acknowledge that the applicable fees and prices reflect this allocation of risk. Because some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitation may not apply. If the foregoing limitation of liability is not enforceable because the SOFTWARE, the services, or the hardware is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment to be defective and to have directly caused bodily injury, death, or property damage, in no event shall NI's liability for property damage exceed the greater of $50,000 (U.S.) or the license fee paid for the SOFTWARE. \par
19.\tab\ul\b Warning.\ulnone  (1) NI PRODUCTS ARE NOT DESIGNED WITH COMPONENTS AND TESTING FOR A LEVEL OF RELIABILITY SUITABLE FOR USE IN OR IN CONNECTION WITH SURGICAL IMPLANTS OR AS CRITICAL COMPONENTS IN ANY LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS WHOSE FAILURE TO PERFORM CAN REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO CAUSE SIGNIFICANT INJURY TO A HUMAN. (2) IN ANY APPLICATION, INCLUDING THE ABOVE, RELIABILITY OF OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS CAN BE IMPAIRED BY ADVERSE FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN ELECTRICAL POWER SUPPLY, COMPUTER HARDWARE MALFUNCTIONS, COMPUTER OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE FITNESS, FITNESS OF COMPILERS AND DEVELOPMENT SOFTWARE USED TO DEVELOP AN APPLICATION, INSTALLATION ERRORS, SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY PROBLEMS, MALFUNCTIONS OR FAILURES OF ELECTRONIC MONITORING OR CONTROL DEVICES, TRANSIENT FAILURES OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS (HARDWARE AND/OR SOFTWARE), UNANTICIPATED USES OR MISUSES, OR ERRORS ON THE PART OF THE USER OR APPLICATIONS DESIGNER (ADVERSE FACTORS SUCH AS THESE ARE HEREAFTER COLLECTIVELY TERMED "SYSTEM FAILURES"). ANY APPLICATION WHERE A SYSTEM FAILURE WOULD CREATE A RISK OF HARM TO PROPERTY OR PERSONS (INCLUDING THE RISK OF BODILY INJURY AND DEATH) SHOULD NOT BE RELIANT SOLELY UPON ONE FORM OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEM DUE TO THE RISK OF SYSTEM FAILURE. TO AVOID DAMAGE, INJURY, OR DEATH, THE USER OR APPLICATION DESIGNER MUST TAKE REASONABLY PRUDENT STEPS TO PROTECT AGAINST SYSTEM FAILURES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO BACK-UP OR SHUT DOWN MECHANISMS. BECAUSE EACH END-USER SYSTEM IS CUSTOMIZED AND DIFFERS FROM NI'S TESTING PLATFORMS AND BECAUSE A USER OR APPLICATION DESIGNER MAY USE NI PRODUCTS IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER PRODUCTS IN A MANNER NOT EVALUATED OR CONTEMPLATED BY NI, THE USER OR APPLICATION DESIGNER IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR VERIFYING AND VALIDATING THE SUITABILITY OF NI PRODUCTS WHENEVER NI PRODUCTS ARE INCORPORATED IN A SYSTEM OR APPLICATION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE APPROPRIATE DESIGN, PROCESS, AND SAFETY LEVEL OF SUCH SYSTEM OR APPLICATION. \par

D.\tab This Agreement (and if applicable the VLP) constitutes the complete agreement between you and NI regarding the SOFTWARE and it supersedes any oral or written proposals, prior agreements, purchase orders, or any other communication between you and NI relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. If there is a conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the VLP Documentation, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall prevail and control. \par
